# 👩‍💻 Romrawin Chumpu

- 👋 Hi, I’m @romrawinjp. Here is my github homepage.
- My Thai name is **Romrawin Chumpu**.
- You can call me **Jin**! That's my nickname. My parents originally named me 進步; it's hard to pronounce most of the time. 
- My career goal is to become a good researcher in the fields of physical simulation and machine learning.
- Recent work - materials simulation areas where I believe that computer graphics and machine learning can lead us to the way we can find a new material.

**Grand challenge in (work) 2024 and beyond** - just stepping back and looking at a big picture of what I was doing after talking to people. I'll continuously do research in the computational material discovery paradigm as much as my knowledge can implement, with a phd or without, because if I am not doing it, who else can process both worlds better than me. It's a very important direction, and I think this paradigm will help tremendously in the near future.

**Grand challenge in life and beyond** - there must be a way to integrate my artistic and technological academic skills together.

## Current interests

- 👀 I’m interested in math with graph and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about deep learning, which are mostly on the way to geometric deep learning.
- ☕ More coffee!
- 📚 I love reading books. Also love reading poems.
- 🎃 I enjoy learning new languages including spoken and programming.
- 😆 Language rank; [Thai(native), English, Chinese, French] - [forgetting] Japanese, German, and Spanish

## Current curiosities

- 🎨 **Why do all greatest artists dust out of this world by poverty before getting to be known for their art pieces?** like Van Gogh, Vivaldi. Yeah, that's the obvious evidence of the more failures you get, the more skills and complexity of artworks you're handful of it. Though, I'm qualified, but how do it not dust out before 😜
