# 👩‍💻 Romrawin Chumpu

- 👋 Hi, I’m @romrawinjp. Here is my github page.
- My name is **Romrawin Chumpu**.
- You can call me **Jin**! My parents originally named me 進步; it's hard to pronounce sometimes. 
- My career goal is to become a good researcher in the fields of physical simulation and machine learning.
- Recent work - materials simulation areas where I believe that computer graphics and machine learning can lead us to the way we can find a new material.

**Grand challenge in (work) 2024 and beyond** - just stepping back and looking at a big picture of what I was doing after talking to people. I'll continuously do research in the computational material discovery paradigm as much as my knowledge can implement, with a phd or without, because if I am not doing it, who else can process both worlds better than me. It's a very important direction, and I think this paradigm will help tremendously in the near future.

**Grand challenge in life and beyond** - there must be a way to integrate my artistic and technological academic skills together.
